This is only a playground for me while I experiment with Node.

To do:
* implement grunt for cleaning up, concatenating, uglifying, etc.
* play with security - probably some form of bearer tokens
* split api and web app into separate projects. They're fine in one for now, though.
* create api endpoint for setting 'got' field to true and setting strikethrough on those items in the web app.
* look around to see if the _id field is generally accepted for api use or if some other name for it should be used.
* profit! ;)
